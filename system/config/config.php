/**
 *  On by default, this causes Cora to use full PSR-4 namespacing rules such that all classes
 *  have a namespace. This prevents almost all namespace conflicts. This means all your controllers
 *  will be in a "Controller" namespace, all your models in a "Model" namespace, etc.
 *
 *  Optionally, you can turn this off. Doing so will allow you to keep your classes un-namespaced
 *  (so long as they aren't in a subfolder), but you will be unable to have classes with the name
 *  name. For instance, you wouldn't be able to have a "User" controller and a "User" model. Instead,
 *  you would have to have a "Users" (plural) controller and a "User" model. The benefit to having
 *  this off is mostly if you are working on integrating Cora with a legacy project that didn't use
 *  namespaces much. Additionally, having this off can declutter your code by making your class
 *  instantiations shorter and ridding you of a ton of "use" statements at the top of your code.
 *  Just make sure you understand the consequences before disabling this.
 *  
 *  HISTORY:
 *  When Cora was first conceived, its purpose was to integrate with an existing legacy project.
 *  In order to do that, controllers and models were left un-namespaced so long as they weren't
 *  in a subfolder. Support for this limited namespacing mode is now turned off by default, but
 *  can optionally be turned on if you want it.
